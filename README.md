# 🗂️ MiniFS – In-Memory File System in Python

**MiniFS** is a terminal-based simulation of a simple file system built entirely in Python. It supports shell-style commands like `mkdir`, `cd`, `touch`, `write`, and `cat`, all executed in-memory using Python objects and data structures — no actual disk I/O involved.

## 🚀 Features

- `mkdir <folder>` – Create a new directory  
- `cd <folder>` / `cd ..` – Navigate into a folder or back  
- `touch <file>` – Create a new file  
- `write <file> <content>` – Write content to a file  
- `cat <file>` – View file content  
- `ls` – List contents of current directory  
- `exit` – Exit the MiniFS shell
